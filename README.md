# Implementation-of-Smartphone-based-Pedestrian-Dead-Reckoning-for-3D-Indoor-Positioning-Systems

The main focus of this project is to determine user behavior and their current floor level, and to display the user's current location on a map in real-time. Typically, determining the user's floor level involves using the barometer sensor in their phone or external devices such as Wi-Fi and Bluetooth as a height reference. However, not all phones are equipped with barometers, and barometric pressure varies with atmospheric temperature and building ventilation. Additionally, methods such as Wi-Fi require external device support. Therefore, this project uses accelerometer values as a reference, combined with behavior recognition to distinguish between going up or down stairs and using elevators, to obtain the user's current height and floor position.
